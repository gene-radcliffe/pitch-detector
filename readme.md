# Online pitch detector.

## Work in progress
```
01/22/2019 - Started project.

- Started laying down the foundations for my BassTuner Application.

- This version will serve to test concepts and apply it to BassTuner


- BassTuner will detect lower / bass frequencies starting at 30.87Hz to 246.9Hz

- I am using the Frequency Domain approach and will employ auto-correlation algorithm to detect the pitch

```
## Controls

1. Tone keys play computer generated tones / notes
2. Audio keys play recorded notes from a bass guitar
3. The canvas will draw the sound wave that each tone generates.
